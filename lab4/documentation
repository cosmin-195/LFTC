Automaton:
filename: String - file from which to read the automaton
states: Map of StateId ->  State - the states of the automaton
initialState: State - the initial state
finalStates: Map of StateId ->  State - the final states of the automaton
transitions: List of (State, State, String) - list of transitions, tuple formed source state, target state, action

is_accepted(token) - returns true if the token is accepted by the FA - parses the token, and tries to find a transition from the current state
to a next state where the action is the current token. If it cannot find a next state, or if the state where it finished is not final, returns false, otherwise returns true.
__read_from_file() - reads the automaton
menu() - displays a menu that displays various information
