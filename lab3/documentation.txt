data structure: hashtable with chaining
add(value) - takes a value and returns a tuple (bucket, position in list)
lookup(bucket,position in list) - returns a value, if it finds it, or None otherwise
hash (value) - if hashing an integer, returns the integer modulo capacity
             - for strings it starts from 5381, loops through the characters while multiplying the value with
              33 and adding the ascii value ( and applies the modulo at the end)
             - was found to have good results in practice
